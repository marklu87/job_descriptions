User Interface Engineer
We're looking for a User Interface engineer with a background in building intuitive human-computer interfaces. We are building an AI platform to simplify the interaction an AI system has to human operators. If you are excited by the challenge of coding the next generation interface which makes an assumption about an intelligent back-end, this role is for you.

We run in the highest compute environments available in the market: currently, we run in a cluster of DGXs from NVIDIA. We are an AI-first company and we believe that “data writes software”. To that end, our stack extends traditional web-based UI by leveraging input/output methods in speech recognition, eye tracking, behavior patter recognition etc.

Our team is a mix of skill sets: folks with Systems background, folks with Deep Learning background, and folks who know a little of everything enterprise. We value being a top-notch organization with a strong engineering-driven culture, and have the same high standards with our code, systems, and people. We value learning and growth (and not being bored) and hire diverse, well-rounded, communicative people we can envision being friends with and trusting.

More About the Job
Develop abstractions and tools to enable rapid experimentation of user interfaces.
