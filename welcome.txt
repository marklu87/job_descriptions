Welcome
We are a team of experts in systems engineering, deep learning, and enterprise solutions. Come join us to build the next generation AI Platform!
At Project Lucy, we are turning the promise of AI into reality. Our platform accelerates enterprise adoption of AI by reducing the average execution time of AI projects from several months to mere days. We leverage the highest throughput compute available in the market, and utilize the latest deep learning research in academia. We are a team of passionate engineers, and are experienced with building multiple facets of large-scale AI systems at enterprises such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, etc. We are well funded and are in a high-growth trajectory.
We value being a top-notch organization with a strong engineering-driven culture, and have the same high standards with our code, systems, and people. We value learning and growth (while not being bored) and hire diverse, well-rounded, communicative people that support our culture of trust and friendship. We are flexible on when and where you work from. Currently, our team is spread across San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Houston, and expanding!
